        <h1><i>ABOUT ME</i></h1>
        <h2>Google Books History<br /><br />In the beginning, there was Google Books.<br />
            <p>Well, not exactly. But one can certainly argue that the project is as old as Google itself. In 1996,
                Google
                co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page were graduate computer science students working on a research
                project
                supported by the Stanford Digital Library Technologies Project. Their goal was to make digital libraries
                work,
                and their big idea was as follows: in a future world in which vast collections of books are digitized,
                people
                would use a “web crawler” to index the book's content and analyze the connections between them,
                determining
                any given book's relevance and usefulness by tracking the number and quality of citations from other
                books.</p><br />
            <p>The crawler they wound up building was called BackRub, and it was this modern twist on traditional
                citation
                analysis that inspired Google's PageRank algorithms - the core search technology that makes Google,
                well, Google.</p><br />
            <p>Even then, Larry and Sergey envisioned people everywhere being able to search through all of the world's
                books to find the ones they're looking for. What they couldn't have imagined was that one day they would
                launch a project to help make it happen.</p>
            <p>(After more than a decade of evolution, innovation and strong partnerships, Google Books has helped
                to make more than 40 million books discoverable, in more than 400 languages.)</p>
